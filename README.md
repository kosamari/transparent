Transparent
===========

Quickly make background color transparent. Try it on [kosamari.github.io/translucent](https://kosamari.github.io/transparent/)

This app grab color of top left corner pixel as reference & turn opacity of every pixel that has same color to 0. (note: this is not perfect ! I'm using this tool to prep base image for my [code annotation](https://twitter.com/kosamari/status/718966165607948288).)
